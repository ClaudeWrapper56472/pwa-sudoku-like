# Nine Lives

A cat-themed logic puzzle, as an installable progressive web app. Ported from the
Godot 4 project in `~/Sites/godot-sudoku`.

No dependencies, no build step, no framework. Plain ES modules served as files.

## The rules

An N×N grid is carved into N irregular colour regions. Place one cat in every
row, every column and every colour — and no two cats may touch, not even
diagonally. Every level has exactly one solution.

Tap a cell to cross it out, or **drag along a row or column to cross the whole
run**. The first cell a drag reaches decides its axis, so a wandering finger
cannot wipe a diagonal through your working. Crossing out is the bulk of play, so
it gets the cheap gesture — and it is free, a note to yourself that is never
checked.

**Double tap a cell** to place a cat. That is the committing move and the only one
that costs anything: a cat on the wrong cell is refused and **spends one of three
lives**. Lose all three and you start that same level again. The first of the two
taps crosses the cell out, so a cat shows a cross for a moment on its way down —
the alternative is every cross waiting to see whether a second tap follows, and
crossing out is far too common to make it wait.

Level 1 is a gentle 5×5 and every level after it is a little harder. Finishing one
moves you up; losing one does not move you back. **Easy, Medium and Hard** on the
menu are three places to join that one ladder rather than three separate settings:
the first 5×5, 7×7 and 9×9 board, always from the beginning of that stretch.

Dropping back to an easier board does not cost you anything. The save keeps two
numbers -- the level you are playing and the furthest you have reached -- and the
menu offers a way back to the furthest one whenever the play button is carrying on
from somewhere else.

**Keyboard:** arrows move, `Space`/`X` crosses out, `Enter`/`C` places a cat,
`Backspace` clears, `H` hints, `Cmd`/`Ctrl`+`Z` undoes, `Esc` leaves. The selected
cell is outlined while you are playing by key; a tap puts the outline away again.
Right-click is the mouse's one-press way to place a cat.

## Running it

Modules, workers and the service worker all need a real origin, so open it over
HTTP rather than as a file:

```bash
cd ~/Sites/pwa-meowdoku
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then http://localhost:8000
```

Installing it from the browser's Add to Home Screen gives a standalone portrait
app that plays offline.

```bash
node tests/verify.mjs      # 115 assertions over the puzzle layer, about a second
```

The self-check needs Node 18 or newer (`structuredClone`, `crypto`). It runs the
whole puzzle layer headlessly, and verifies every one of the 320 shipped levels
is legal, uniquely solvable and rated to the tier it is filed under.

## Deploying

A push to `main` runs the self-check and, if it passes, publishes to GitHub
Pages. There is no build step: the job copies the app's files into `_site` and
uploads that, so the list in `.github/workflows/pages.yml` has to stay in step
with `ASSETS` in `sw.js`.

Settings → Pages → Source has to be set to **GitHub Actions** for the workflow to
have anywhere to publish to. Every URL in the app is relative, so it runs under
the project path without any base configuration.

## What the port changed

The puzzle layer is a direct translation — same algorithms, same constants, same
save format at version 4, so the shipped level bank is used unmodified. What had
to move is everything that touched the engine.

| Godot | Here |
|---|---|
| Signals | `Emitter`: `on(name, fn)` / `emit(name, …)` with real arguments |
| `Thread` for generation and prefetch | Two long-lived module Web Workers, one request/reply each |
| `RandomNumberGenerator` | `Rng`, PCG32 in BigInt, so a seed still reproduces a level |
| `_draw()` per cell | One div per cell: CSS for the fill and outline, inline SVG for the cross, an `<img>` for the cat |
| `_gui_input` with touch and mouse branches | Pointer events on `window` for the length of the gesture, one path for both |
| `user://sudoku_save.json`, temp file plus rename | `localStorage`, where a write is already all-or-nothing |
| `NOTIFICATION_APPLICATION_PAUSED` and friends | `visibilitychange`, `pagehide`, `freeze` |
| `PackedByteArray` / `PackedInt32Array` | `Uint8Array` / `Int32Array` |
| `Vector2i` cells in the rater | Packed `row * size + col` indices |
| `Theme` resource plus `palette.gd` | Custom properties in the stylesheet plus `ui/palette.js` |
| `AspectRatioContainer` and `SquareSlot` | `aspect-ratio: 1` on the grid |
| `tools/build_level_bank.gd` | Not ported. The bank is shipped content; regenerate it in the Godot project. |

Cell metrics are the one place the drawing model shows through. Godot computed
corner radius, outline width and the cat's overhang from the cell's pixel size
inside `_draw()`. `BoardView` measures the board once and publishes `--cell` and
`--gap`, and every one of those rules is a `calc()` off those two numbers.

Placing a cat is a hold rather than a double-tap. A double-tap has to cross the
cell out on the first tap, because nothing at that moment knows a second is
coming, and then paint the cat over it -- so the cross visibly flashes on and off
under the move replacing it, and lands on the undo stack having never been asked
for. A hold fires before anything is released, so no tap ever happens.

The drag also gained an axis. The original locked a run to the row it started
in; here the first cell the drag reaches decides row or column, which keeps the
same protection against a careless swipe wiping a diagonal while making vertical
runs possible.

### One bug fixed rather than reproduced

A command already on the undo stack can name a cell that has since been settled.
Cross a cell, clear the board, then lose a life on that same cell: the clear
command still holds the old cross, and reverting it repaints over the red the
game paid a life to establish. The Godot original has the same hole — its smoke
test covers undoing out of a *loss*, not this sequence.

Commands now write through `PuzzleState.putIfEditable`, which refuses to disturb
a cell holding a cat or a red cross. No command ever legitimately targets one:
every entry point already checks before creating the command, so the guard only
ever fires on a stale record.

## Deliberate omissions

- **No sound, no animation.** The cats are static.
- **No tutorial.** The rules fit in one line, which the game screen shows on load.
- **No level select.** You are on a level; you play that level.
- **No settings screen.** `Settings` has the plumbing and no options to show yet.
- **The rater stops at locked groups.** Deeper chain reasoning would let the
  generator accept levels it currently rejects.
