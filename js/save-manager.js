 * happens. That keeps this file free of any knowledge of GameState, and it means
 * a second system with state to persist only has to listen.
 *
 * Where the Godot build wrote a temp file and renamed it, localStorage.setItem is
 * already all-or-nothing, so there is no torn write to defend against. What does
 * carry over is *when* we write: a browser tab can be discarded without warning,
