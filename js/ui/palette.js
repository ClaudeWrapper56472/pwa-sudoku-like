/**
 * Every colour the game draws from script, in one place.

 * Warm paper rather than the usual puzzle-app slate: the board should look like

 * The split mirrors the original's two colour systems. Widget chrome -- buttons,
 * cards, label colours -- lives in the stylesheet as custom properties, which is
 * what CSS is for. What is here is the part a stylesheet cannot say: "this cell
 * belongs to region 4". A region's colour is chosen per level, per cell, at
 * runtime, so it is set as an inline custom property and the rest of the cell's
 * appearance derives from it.
