/**
 * Save-format versioning.
 *
 * Pure functions, no storage access, so migration can be checked without
 * touching localStorage -- which matters, because a migration bug corrupts real
 * players' progress and is the one thing you cannot hotfix after the fact.
 *
 * The rule: every save carries a version, migration only ever moves forward one
 * step at a time, and an unrecognised or newer version is discarded rather than
 * guessed at.
 *
 * Each step is exported so it can be checked on its own. The chain is only as
 * trustworthy as its weakest link, and testing only the whole chain hides which
 * link broke.
 *
 * Version history
 *   1  Flat document. Marks as an array of small integers, difficulty as a
 *      display name, stats keyed by difficulty name, no undo history.
 *   2  Session and stats separated. Marks as one character per cell, difficulty
 *      as a tier value, plus undo history, hint counts and the streak.
 *   3  A wrong cat ends the level, and placing one no longer crosses out cells.
 *      Commands are single-cell.
 *   4  One climbing progression instead of a difficulty menu. Stats gain a
 *      progress block; the session records its level.
